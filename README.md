PLATORUN is a mobile, database, web and API test automation framework that is written in Java using IntelliJ IDE. It automates testing of native android application packages (ex: Calculator, Facebook, Google Maps, etcâ€¦) using Appium, Selenium Web application testing, database testing with MySQL & SQL Server, and API web services utilizing behavior-driven development technique with Cucumber Gherkin language to create test scenarios that can be easily understood by non-programmers, business analysts and managers that illustrates business rules in a human-readable fashion. It is also integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, and Github for source code management to help in tracking history of changes and resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple contributors. 

To effectively analyze test execution results and anticipate bug detection earlier, a comprehensive report is available for viewing. It is laid out in different formats including HTML, PDF, XML, and JSON. The report is organized into a summary of testing objectives, feature scenarios, results, as well as pie charts and timeline bar charts.
